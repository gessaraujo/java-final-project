# **Java API Assessment**
# **Film and Series Management API :camera_flash: **


## **Introduction**
The Film and Series Management API is a RESTful web service designed to facilitate the management of films and series on a platform. 
This API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting films and series, as well as managing associated data such as genres, directors, actors, and more.


### **Features:**

CRUD Operations: Create, retrieve, update, and delete operations for films and series.
Genre Management: Manage genres for films and series.





### Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gessaraujo/java-final-project
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal at the root of the repo directory and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```sh
./mvnw clean dependency:resolve
```

If you are on a Windows machine, that will be:
```cmd
mvnw clean dependency:resolve
```

You should see console output similar to the following:

```sh

```

#### 3. Running the Application

To start the API in VS Code, press `F5` or tap the 'Play' icon for the `api-assessment` app in the Spring Boot Dashboard.

Alternatively, to start the API from the terminal, run the following command:

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Or on Windows:

```cmd
mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You should see console output similar to the following (press `Ctrl + C` to exit):

```sh

## **Deliverables**

Ensure that your work is merged to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository by the specified deadline (original or extended). Your solution will assessed based on its state *at that point*; any later commits will **not** be taken into account.

## FAQs

- Q: How can I process JSON in Java?
    
    A: There are a number of open-source packages that you can use to manipulate JSON. We recommend [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), but you can also investigate alternatives like [json-simple](https://github.com/cliftonlabs/json-simple) or [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/).

- Q: Can I use another IDE I'm more familiar with instead of VS Code, like IntelliJ or Eclipse?

    A: You can if you wish, but only VS Code is formally supported by CBF Academy staff, so you do so at your own risk.

## Top Tips

- :camera_flash: Commit frequently and use meaningful commit messages. A granular, well-labelled history becomes an increasingly valuable asset over time.
- :cactus: Use feature branches. Build the habit of isolating your changes for specific tasks and merging them into your default branch when complete.
- :vertical_traffic_light: Use consistent naming conventions. Choose easily understandable names and naming patterns for your classes, functions and variables.
- :triangular_ruler: Keep your code tidy. Using the built-in formatting of VS Code or other IDEs makes your code easier to read and mistakes easier to spot.
- :books: Read the docs. Whether via Intellisense in your IDE, or browsing online documentation, build a clear understanding of the libraries your code leverages.
- :calendar: Don't wait until the last minute. Plan your work early and make the most of the time available to complete the assessment and avoid pre-deadline palpitations.
- :sos: Ask. :clap: For. :clap: Help! :clap: Your mentors, instructors and assistants are literally here to support you, so *make use of them* - don't sit and struggle in silence.

Best of luck! Remember, it's not just about the destination; it's the journey. Happy coding! ðŸš€
